            <div className="about-section">
                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>My name is Brett Russell. I'm 27 years old, and my personality type is INTJ. I was born and raised in regional Victoria before moving to Melbourne in 2018 where I currently reside.</p>

                <h2>Why choose web development?</h2>
                <p> From a very young age, I've always found great fulfilment in learning new things. In particular, I tend to find that the more complex a subject becomes while i'm learning about it, the more fascinating it becomes to me. This fascination drives me to seek out and understand further complexities within it. I'm completely new to web and software development, having no prior experience in any IT-related field. However, I thoroughly enjoy learning about the way in which coding languages are constructed and how they interconnect to create the apps, websites and software we use daily. I also believe that this industry is ever evolving, and I'm excited by the prospect of being a part of its growth or, at the very least gain an insider's perspective on the advancement of the IT industry as it moves forward. 
                </p>

                <h2>What are my interests?</h2>
                <p>I have a few hobbies that keep me busy in my spare time. My favourite passion is music; I've been playing the guitar for over 16 years and dedicate alot of my free time to practicing and even writing my own songs. When im not doing that, I enjoy going to the gym most days, gaming, and wacthing movies and TV series. I'm also a big fan of anime and manga. A fun fact anout me that often surprises alot of people is that, as one of my hobbies, I used to make extra money as a professional poker player.</p>
